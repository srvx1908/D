⚙️: Create Collections and Insert Sample Data

👉 Insert Documents into Teachers

db.Teachers.insertMany([
  { Tname: "Praveen", dno: 101, dname: "Computer", experience: 8, salary: 12000, date_of_joining: "2015-06-15" },
  { Tname: "Sujata", dno: 102, dname: "IT", experience: 6, salary: 9500, date_of_joining: "2017-09-10" },
  { Tname: "Ramesh", dno: 103, dname: "E&TC", experience: 9, salary: 13000, date_of_joining: "2014-03-20" },
  { Tname: "Sneha", dno: 104, dname: "Mechanical", experience: 5, salary: 8500, date_of_joining: "2019-07-01" }
])


👉 Insert Documents into Students

db.Students.insertMany([
  { Sname: "Rahul", roll_no: 1, class: "SE Comp" },
  { Sname: "XYZ", roll_no: 2, class: "TE IT" },
  { Sname: "Priya", roll_no: 3, class: "BE E&TC" }
])


🔹 Q1. Find the information about all teachers

db.Teachers.find()


🔹 Q2. Find the information about all teachers of Computer department

db.Teachers.find({ dname: "Computer" })


🔹 Q3. Find the information about all teachers of Computer, IT, and E&TC department

db.Teachers.find({ dname: { $in: ["Computer", "IT", "E&TC"] } })


🔹 Q4. Find the information about all teachers of Computer, IT, and E&TC department having salary ≥ 10000


db.Teachers.find({
  dname: { $in: ["Computer", "IT", "E&TC"] },
  salary: { $gte: 10000 }
})


🔹 Q5. Find the student information having roll_no = 2 or Sname = "xyz"

db.Students.find({
  $or: [
    { roll_no: 2 },
    { Sname: "XYZ" }
  ]
})


🔹 **Q6. Update the experience of teacher “Praveen” to 10 years.

db.Teachers.updateOne(
  { Tname: "Praveen" },
  { $set: { experience: 10 } },
  { upsert: true }
)

🔹 Q7. Update the department of all teachers working in IT department to COMP

db.Teachers.updateMany(
  { dname: "IT" },
  { $set: { dname: "COMP" } }
)


🔹 Q8. Find the teachers’ names and their experience from teachers collection

db.Teachers.find({}, { Tname: 1, experience: 1, _id: 0 })


🔹 Q9. Using save() method insert one entry in department collection

db.department.save({
  dept_id: 201,
  dept_name: "Civil",
  location: "Building A"
})



🧾: Verify the Update

db.Teachers.find({ Tname: "Praveen" })

🧠 Theory: MongoDB Database – ICEM

MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like BSON format instead of tables and rows. It provides high performance, flexibility, and scalability for modern applications.

In this problem, we create a database named ICEM with two collections:

Teachers(Tname, dno, dname, experience, salary, date_of_joining)
→ Stores details of teachers in various departments.

Students(Sname, roll_no, class)
→ Stores details of students with their roll numbers and class.


Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates how MongoDB performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using collections and documents.
It highlights how query operators and update functions help manage real-world educational data efficiently in a non-relational database system.
